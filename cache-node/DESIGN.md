# Cache Node Design

## Overview

Each cache node in our distributed cache system will be responsible for storing and retrieving data assigned to it by the partition strategy. The nodes need to be high-performance, reliable, and capable of handling thousands of concurrent requests with sub-millisecond response times.

## Architecture

We'll use a hybrid approach:

1. **C-based Core Storage Engine**
   - Responsible for the actual data storage and retrieval
   - Optimized for memory efficiency and low latency
   - Implemented as a shared library that can be loaded by the JVM

2. **Java/Spring Boot Wrapper**
   - Provides a RESTful API for the Cache Coordinator to communicate with
   - Handles node registration, health reporting, and coordination
   - Uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to communicate with the C storage engine

## C Storage Engine Features

### Data Structures
- Hash table for O(1) lookups
- Custom memory allocator to minimize fragmentation and reduce GC pauses
- Lock-free data structures where possible to maximize concurrency

### Memory Management
- Configurable memory limits
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- Optional persistence to disk for recovery

### Concurrency
- Fine-grained locking or lock-free algorithms for high throughput
- Read-write locks to allow concurrent reads
- Thread pool with configurable size for handling requests

## Java Wrapper Features

### Node Management
- Registration with the coordinator service
- Health check endpoints
- Configuration management

### Metrics Collection
- Hit/miss ratio
- Latency measurements
- Memory usage statistics
- Current item count

### Communication
- RESTful API for coordinator service
- Potential gRPC implementation for lower overhead

## Performance Targets
- Support for at least 10,000 concurrent requests
- Sub-millisecond (<1ms) response time for 99.9% of requests
- Minimal memory overhead beyond stored data

## Fault Tolerance
- Data replication across multiple nodes (configured by replication factor)
- Automatic redistribution of data when nodes join/leave
- Periodic synchronization with backup nodes
- Graceful degradation under extreme load

## Future Considerations
- Support for data types beyond simple key-value pairs
- Time-to-live (TTL) settings for cache entries
- Batch operations for improved throughput
- Integration with external monitoring systems
