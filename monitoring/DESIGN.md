# Monitoring System Design

## Overview

The monitoring system will track cache performance metrics, latency, and system health across the distributed cache service. It will provide real-time visibility into the behavior and performance of the cache system, enabling operators to detect and respond to issues quickly.

## Architecture

The monitoring system will consist of:

1. **Data Collection Agents**
   - Embedded in each cache node and the coordinator service
   - Collect metrics at regular intervals
   - Minimal overhead to avoid impacting performance

2. **Central Metrics Store**
   - Time-series database (e.g., Prometheus)
   - Stores historical metrics for trend analysis
   - Supports aggregation across multiple nodes

3. **Visualization Dashboard**
   - Web-based UI (e.g., Grafana)
   - Real-time views of system performance
   - Customizable dashboards for different user roles

## Key Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of requests served from cache vs. missed
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second handled by each node and system overall
- **Throughput**: Data transfer rate in/out of the cache
- **Response Time Distribution**: Percentiles (p50, p90, p99, p99.9) of request latencies

### System Health
- **Node Status**: Up/down status of each node
- **CPU Usage**: Per node and system-wide
- **Memory Usage**: Current memory consumption and available memory
- **Network I/O**: Bytes sent/received between nodes

### Cache-Specific Metrics
- **Eviction Rate**: Items evicted due to memory pressure
- **Rebalance Operations**: Frequency and duration of data rebalancing
- **Cache Size**: Number of keys and total data size
- **Key Distribution**: How evenly keys are distributed across nodes

## Alerting System

- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Notify operators when metrics exceed predefined thresholds
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Alert Channels**: Email, SMS, Slack integration
- **Escalation Policies**: Define escalation paths for unresolved issues

## Implementation Details

### Data Collection
- Use of Micrometer for metrics collection in Java components
- Custom instrumentation for C components
- Sampling strategies to reduce overhead for high-frequency metrics

### Storage
- Local buffer for metrics in case of connectivity issues
- Configurable retention policy for historical data
- Compression for efficient storage

### Visualization
- Real-time dashboards with sub-second refresh
- Historical trend analysis
- Heat maps for latency distribution
- Topology views showing node relationships

## Integration Points

- **Kubernetes Integration**: Use Kubernetes metrics API for container-level metrics
- **Logging**: Correlation between metrics and log events
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows across services
- **External Monitoring**: Export metrics to existing enterprise monitoring systems

## Performance Requirements

- Minimal overhead (<1% CPU/memory) on cache nodes
- Sub-second metric collection frequency
- Dashboard refresh rate of 1-5 seconds
- Query response time <100ms for most dashboard views
