# Distributed Cache Service

A high-performance distributed caching system designed to handle 10,000+ concurrent requests with sub-millisecond response times.

## Overview

This distributed cache service provides a scalable, fault-tolerant solution for caching data across multiple nodes. It uses advanced data partitioning algorithms to ensure balanced distribution of data and maintains data redundancy for fault tolerance.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Cache Coordinator Service**
   - Central coordination service for routing requests to appropriate cache nodes
   - Implements consistent hashing for data partitioning
   - Tracks node health and manages the cluster topology
   - Provides a RESTful API for cache operations

2. **Cache Nodes**
   - Store and retrieve cached data
   - Implement high-performance storage using C for core operations
   - Include Java wrappers for integration with the coordinator service

3. **Monitoring System**
   - Tracks performance metrics, latency, and system health
   - Provides real-time dashboards and alerting

## Features

- **High Concurrency**: Handles 10,000+ concurrent requests
- **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond response times for cache operations
- **Data Partitioning**: Consistent hashing ensures balanced data distribution
- **Fault Tolerance**: Data replication across multiple nodes
- **Auto-Rebalancing**: Automatic redistribution of data when nodes join or leave
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for performance and health

## API Endpoints

### Cache Operations

- `GET /api/cache/{key}` - Retrieve a value from the cache
- `PUT /api/cache/{key}` - Store a value in the cache
- `DELETE /api/cache/{key}` - Remove a value from the cache
- `GET /api/cache` - Get cache statistics

### Node Management

- `GET /api/nodes` - List all active nodes
- `POST /api/nodes` - Register a new cache node
- `DELETE /api/nodes/{nodeId}` - Remove a node from the cluster

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (for orchestrated deployment)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build the coordinator service
cd cache-coordinator-service
mvn clean package
```

### Running the Service

```bash
# Run the coordinator service
java -jar cache-coordinator-service/target/cache-coordinator-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Deployment

The service can be deployed as containers in a Kubernetes cluster for production use. Refer to the `deploy` directory for Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests.

## Technologies

- **Languages**: Java, C
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (planned)
